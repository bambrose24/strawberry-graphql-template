# Strawberry GraphQL Template

A template for [Strawberry GraphQL](https://strawberry.rocks/) that can be deployed immediately to Railway.

This has two Dockerfiles that can be used to deploy a development server with introspection, as well as a production-ready Flask server. The flask server will simply delegate to the Strawberry View.

Read more about how to set up a strong Strawberry GraphQL server at [their docs](https://strawberry.rocks/docs).
